Object Orientation: Persepective (The way of lookin..)

Rules of O.O:
1) The world is collection of objects
2) Every object is usefull object and no object is useless
3) Every object is in constant interaction with other objects,
    no object is isolated
4) Every object belongs to a type [type is nothing but class]
5) Type doesn't exists in reality, only objects of that type exists
    in reality 
6) Every object has 2 parts 
    1) has part : It represents the properties of the object
    2) does part : It presents the behaviour of the object
