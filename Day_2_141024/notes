Problem Statement: Develop a program that illustrates Guess Number
    Solution: GusserGame.java 

Variable: Giving some name to the memory location 

    Allowed Characters:     A-Z
                            a-z 
                            0-9
                            _,$

                Valid Varibales:
                    Name   Valid/Not             
                    abc      Yes
                    526a     No
                    _myName  yes
                    _        No
                    $        No
                    myName   yes   (camel Case)
                    MyName   yes   (Pascal)
                    my_name  yes   (snake case)
                    my-name  no    (kebab case)
variable name is technically called identifiers
Identifier Rules:
1) Only above allowed characters can be used as identifier
2) It should only follow camel Case
3) No variable can start with Number
4) No varibale can only have single character of special character
5) We should use any keywords as identifier

Keywords: Reserved words by java, which does some specific operations
    Ex: public, class, static, void, int, String, etc

Literals: The values assigned to variables

Ex:
        int x = 5;
